# web-scraping-challenge
In this repo, I scrape NASA's website and use Flask and MongoDB to display the information scraped.

In the mission_to_mars.ipynb, find the script to scrape for Mars facts from various websites.

In the scrape_mars.py, find the script translated into a function for scraping.

The mars_app.py uses Flask to run scrape_mars.py function and passes the data into an html template (find template in templates folder). The template uses Bootstrap for design.
